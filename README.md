# Custom-Floating-Islands
Floating Island style world generation, but using different noise settings and or custom requests I have had over-time.




Some Datapack's made possible thanks to Jochen Jacobs' worldgen noise editor, Snowcapped!

Snowcapped: https://snowcapped.jacobsjo.eu Jochen Jacobs' Github: https://github.com/jacobsjo

Strongly recommend trying it out if you are a datapack create, and show your support to him if you use this datapack!
