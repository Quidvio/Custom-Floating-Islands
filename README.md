# Custom-Floating-Islands
Floating Island style world generation, but using different noise settings and or custom requests I have had over-time.




Some Datapack's in here made possible thanks to Jochen Jacobs' worldgen noise editor, Snowcapped!

Strongly recommend trying it out if you want to mess around with worldgen, and show your support to him if you use this datapack!
